StructGuard

AI-Powered Structural Health Monitoring & Failure Prediction System

StructGuard is an intelligent infrastructure monitoring platform that transforms sparse sensor data and periodic drone imagery into certified structural health insights. It detects early fatigue, predicts failure risk, and enables proactive maintenance across entire cities.

Overview

StructGuard combines AI, advanced 3D reconstruction, and hybrid edge-cloud computing to monitor bridges, flyovers, tunnels, and other critical infrastructure at city scale — using minimal sensor deployment.

The system converts raw stress/strain signals into interpretable structural health scores for municipalities and infrastructure authorities.


 Core Technology Stack

1. 3D Gaussian Splatting

Drone imagery reconstructs photorealistic structural 3D models with millimeter-level precision, enabling full spatial understanding of infrastructure health.

2. AI/ML Fatigue Engine

Deep learning models fuse multi-modal sensor data to:

* Detect early structural fatigue
* Predict failure probability
* Generate proactive maintenance alerts

 3. Edge + Cloud Hybrid Architecture

* Low-latency real-time alerts at the edge
* City-wide monitoring and analytics on a centralized cloud dashboard

 4. Federated Learning

A shared multi-city learning model that improves with every deployment while preserving local data privacy.

 Our Differentiator: Structural Authenticity at City Scale

* Deploy sparse sensors + periodic drone scans
* Reconstruct full 3D structural health using Gaussian Splatting
* Convert raw stress/strain signals into certified structural health scores
* AI predicts failure risks before visible damage occurs
* Unified platform covering entire cities — bridges, tunnels, flyovers, retaining walls

Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

* Traditional IoT platforms monitor isolated point data without spatial 3D context
* Computer vision solutions require dense sensor networks, limiting city-scale viability
* No existing system provides structural authenticity certification at scale with minimal sensor coverage

Key Features

* Real-time structural stress/strain monitoring
* 3D infrastructure reconstruction
* AI-driven fatigue detection
* Failure probability prediction
* Proactive maintenance alerts
* Scalable city-wide dashboard
